            <h2>
                The Story
            </h2>
            <p>Once upon a time, on a dark night in front of a computer screen in 1995, a young boy discovered Internet for the first time. This boy realized that everyone with Internet could read what someone else wrote. The boy realized that the media lanscape would be changed forever. Media content would be created by the people, not only the big old media companies. Things would get personal, people with the same interests would be able to connect in serveral ways. This thing (the Internet) was an opptunity to create a better world and to help people to connect. After a week or two this boy started to create his own website.</p>
            <p>to be continued</p>
            <p>Since I ended High School I have been working with my websites full-time. A couple of years ago (2020) I took a job at the ecommerce <a href="https://strongerlabel.com/">Stronger</a> and worked there almost 2 years. The last year I have been working again with my own projects, lived in the northern part of Sweden and started to study to <strong>Front End Developer</strong>.</p>
            <p>My goal is to mainly learn more JavaScript and after studies work as a Front End Developer in Stockholm.</p>
            <h2>
                I'm an architect
            </h2>
            <p>In the Myers Ggibbs personality test they say that I'm a <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality">INTJ personality</a> (). I have a legit interest in computers. In my freetime I hang out a lot with friends and my girlfriend. In my freetime I enjoy walks, soccer and computer games. Starcraft 2 APM is around 150.</p>
