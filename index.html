    <h2>The story</h2>
    <p>I have been building websites since a was a 11 year old boy. Since I ended High School I have been working with my websites full-time. A couple of years ago (2020) I took a job at the ecommerce <a href="https://strongerlabel.com/">Stronger</a> and worked there almost 2 years. The last year I have been working again with my own projects, lived in the northern part of Sweden and started to study to <strong>Front End Developer</strong>.</p>
    <p>My goal is to mainly learn more JavaScript and after studies work as a Front End Developer in Stockholm.</p>
