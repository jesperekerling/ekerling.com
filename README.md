The code to my portfolio site :)

See live version: [ekerling.com](https://ekerling.com/)




The website uses SASS for CSS styling.

So the build/create new CSS you need to build the CSS files if you change any CSS. Command in SASS:
sass css/styles.scss css/styles.css



And to start watch:
ass css/styles.scss css/styles.css --watch 

--watch makes the css automatically build new css files when something changes in the css-files. For it to work you need SASS installed on your computer, read more at https://sass-lang.com/install/
