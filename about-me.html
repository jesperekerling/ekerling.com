                </p>
                <p>I've been developing websites since 1996, and after graduating high school, I began working full-time in web development. In 2015, I expanded my focus by consulting for Swedish e-commerce companies, which further honed my skills. In 2020, I took on a role at <strong>Stronger</strong>, a leading e-commerce brand, where I worked for two years. After that, I returned to my own projects, spent some time living in northern Sweden, and began studying JavaScript to become a better <strong>Front End Developer</strong>.</p>
                <p>My primary goal now is to deepen my knowledge of JavaScript. Once I complete my studies, I aim to work as a Front-End Developer in Stockholm or a similar role in the tech field.</p>
                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>As for my personality, the Myers-Briggs test identifies me as an INTJ (<a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality">Architect personality</a>). I have a genuine passion for technology and computers. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with friends and my girlfriend, walking, playing soccer, and gaming. My Starcraft 2 APM (actions per minute) is around 150-200â€”a testament to my competitive spirit in gaming!</p>

                <p class="text-center">Are you ready?</p>
                <p>Once upon a time, on a dark night in 1995, a young boy sat in front of a glowing computer screen and discovered the Internet for the very first time. From that moment, nothing would ever be the same again.</p>
                <p>He instantly grasped the profound impact this new medium would have on global communication and traditional media (radio, TV, and books). For the first time, anyone could create and share content, and everyone could access it instantlyâ€”without even paying.</p>
                
                <h3>My first website</h3>
                <p>Just one week later, that boy began building his first website. Four years after that, he asked for his own domain name: <a href="/#jesper.nu">jesper.nu</a>.</p>
                <p>I dabbled in all kinds of content: starting a satirical "religion," creating jackass-style pranks and fails, and even producing my own CD albumâ€”anything to generate traffic for the website and get noticed.</p>
                
                <h3>The brutal truth</h3>
                <p>As time went on, I built a small statistics script to analyze what content was most popular. While the script worked perfectly, it led me to a sobering realization: my visitors werenâ€™t that interested in me. They were far more drawn to funny stories, cute cats, and prank calls. So I shifted gears and started curating humorous content, updating the site more frequently to keep the traffic flowing.</p>

                <h3>The Rise of Broadband</h3>
                <p>Between 2002 and 2007, Sweden saw the widespread adoption of fixed high-speed internet through ADSL. With faster, more reliable connections, users could browse the web freely, consuming richer content like videos, music, and games. Streaming, though still low-quality, began to take off.</p>
                <p>For jesper.nu, this meant users could now upload photos and videos, play games, interact with one another through chat, rate pictures, and even collaborate on creative projects. The internetâ€”and jesper.nuâ€”became a lot more fun.</p>

                <h3>Growth and Decline</h3>
                <p>As content expanded, so did jesper.nu. It was a thrilling journeyâ€”creating, learning, and growing. But after 15 years of growth, from zero to a significant web presence, things began to decline around 2010-2013. The rise of smartphones, YouTube, and Facebook gradually overshadowed my platform.</p>

                <h3>The Blogging Era</h3>
                <p>In response, I launched another website, for.me, as jesper.nu began to wane. At the time, blogging was booming in Sweden, and for.me thrived. With its simple interface and clean design, it quickly became the third most popular blogging platform in the country.</p>

                <h3>E-Commerce Clients</h3>
                <p>After finishing high school, I worked on my websites full-time. However, around 2014, I began consulting for a Swedish e-commerce brand. This came naturally, as my blog site was driving a significant amount of clothing sales through ads. My focus soon shifted to external consultancy work.</p>

                <h3>The Influencer Shift</h3>
                <p>Over the years, I expanded my consulting to other e-commerce brands, primarily focusing on affiliate marketing and influencer collaborations. During the blogging era, affiliate marketing was huge, but as social media platforms like Instagram and YouTube grew, influencers moved away from blogs. E-commerce brands began to see great success working with influencers on these newer platforms.</p>

                <h3>My first job</h3>
                <p>In 2020, I took my first formal job at the e-commerce company <a href="https://strongerlabel.com/" target="_blank">Stronger</a>, where I worked for nearly two years. Afterward, I returned to my own projects, lived in northern Sweden, and began studying to become a <strong>Front End Developer</strong>.</p>
                
                <h3>Looking Forward</h3>
                <p>My main goal now is to deepen my understanding of JavaScript and, after completing my studies, begin working as a Front-End Developer in Stockholm, or in a similar role.</p>
